# stage0-pi3-bringup

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of System-on-Chip (SoC) bring-up, specifically targeting the BCM2837 of the Raspberry Pi 3. The project demonstrates how to perform SoC bring-up from scratch, implementing all necessary components for system initialization and peripheral management.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to illustrate:

- **SoC Bring-up Process**: Step-by-step implementation of the BCM2837 SoC initialization process
- **MISRA C:2012 Best Practices**: All C modules strictly adhere to MISRA C:2012 guidelines to ensure code safety and reliability
- **Low-Level Assembly Programming**: Assembly modules for boot and critical peripheral initialization
- **ARM Cortex-A53 Architecture**: Exploitation of ARM Cortex-A53 core-specific features

## System Architecture

### Target Hardware
- **SoC**: Broadcom BCM2837 (Raspberry Pi 3)
- **CPU**: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 64-bit
- **Architecture**: ARMv8-A

### Core Components

1. **Boot Sequence**: Implementation of the boot process from system reset
2. **Peripheral Initialization**: Configuration and setup of primary peripherals
3. **Memory Management**: MMU setup and memory space management
4. **Interrupt Handling**: Interrupt management system

## Code Structure

- **Assembly Modules**: Boot sequence handling and low-level hardware initialization
- **MISRA-compliant C Modules**: System functionality implementation following MISRA C:2012
- **Header Files**: Hardware register definitions and data structures
- **Linker Scripts**: Memory configuration and code layout

## Technical Features

### MISRA C:2012 Compliance
- Adherence to mandatory and advisory rules
- Safe and maintainable code
- Comprehensive documentation of deviations (if present)

### Assembly Implementation
- Custom boot vector
- Stack pointer initialization
- System register configuration
- Critical peripheral setup

## Usage

This project serves as an educational reference and template for:
- Embedded developers working with ARM SoCs
- Engineers interested in bare-metal system bring-up
- Students of embedded systems and ARM architectures
- Professionals requiring MISRA C:2012 compliant code

## Development Notes

The project is structured to be easily comprehensible and modifiable, with particular emphasis on code documentation and explanation of fundamental SoC bring-up concepts.
